# Dotfiles

Manage my dotfiles. Basicly tested on OSX / Ubuntu, but some configuration like
zsh and vim should be able to migrate to other os distribution easily.

## The purpose

When I am in a new machine, I'd like to build my enviroment from zero over copy
from existed enviroment (which may cause a lot of wired problems).

## Install

Install is quite easy, just follow the steps below.

1. `git clone https://github.com/kiooss/dotmagic.git ~/.dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
3. `./install.sh`

## Vim
Now on vim8 / neovim.

### Vim plugin manager

## Zsh Plugins
<!-- Zsh plugins are managed with [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug). -->
